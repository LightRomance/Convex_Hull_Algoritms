# Convex_Hull_Algoritms

This Python program computes the convex hull of a set of 2D points using a divide-and-conquer algorithm implementation. The convex hull is a fundamental concept in computational geometry and represents the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given set of points.

## Features

- Computes the convex hull of a set of randomly generated 2D points.
- Uses both a divide-and-conquer algorithm and SciPy's ConvexHull implementation to compute the convex hull.
- Measures and displays the execution time of the algorithm.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `convex_hull_Divide.py` file.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Run the code**: Execute the code and follow the prompts to input the number of points. The program will generate a random set of points and calculate their convex hull. The result will include the time taken for the computation.
4. Viewing Convex Hull Points** (Optional): If you wish to view the specific set of points that make up the convex hull, you can uncomment the relevant code sections.
